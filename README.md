# Predictive-Modeling-for-Agriculture
This project aims to help farmers choose the best crop to plant based on essential soil metrics. Using machine learning techniques, we predict the most suitable crop for a given field based on measurements of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), and pH levels in the soil.

## Project Overview
Farmers often face difficulties in selecting the optimal crop for their fields, as soil analysis can be costly and time-consuming. This project uses a dataset that includes key soil metrics and the corresponding optimal crop, allowing for the prediction of the best crop based on these values. The model assists farmers by making crop selection more data-driven, reducing the guesswork and improving yield potential.

## Dataset
- `N:` Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
- `P:` Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
- `K:` Potassium content ratio in the soil
- `pH:` pH value of the soil
- `crop:` The crop that is optimal for the given soil condition (target variable)
The dataset is provided in `soil_measures.csv.`

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a multi-class classification model to predict the most suitable crop for a field based on its soil metrics. We will also identify the single most important feature that contributes to the model's performance.

## Project Structure
- notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow:
    - Data loading and preprocessing
    - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
    - Model building and evaluation
    - Feature importance analysis

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - scikit-learn
You can install all dependencies using the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Steps
1. Data Preprocessing:
- Load the dataset and handle missing values (if any).
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of the features and target variable.
2. Modeling:
- Build classification models to predict the "crop" based on soil metrics.
- Evaluate various algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Trees) using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Use cross-validation for robust model evaluation.
3. Feature Importance:
- Identify the most important feature contributing to the prediction of crop suitability using techniques such as feature importance ranking or SHAP values.

## Results
The final model will predict the optimal crop based on the soilâ€™s nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, and pH levels. Additionally, we will report the most important soil metric that has the greatest influence on the model's predictive performance.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the required dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
`jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb`
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Conclusion
This project provides a machine learning model that predicts the optimal crop based on soil metrics, helping farmers make informed decisions and potentially improving crop yield by optimizing soil conditions.
